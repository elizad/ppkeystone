							p.lead2 Shaun, Found a £27,603 pension with Prudential. Lives in Penarth
							p The result of my pension trace was great! Profile helped me find pensions that I’d lost through moving employers and put everything into layman’s terms. Even though I paid out, I’m better off in the long run and in control of my pension pot.

							p.lead2 Mark, Found a £24,899 pension with Re-assure. Lives in Bath
							p The process was entirely pain free, very professional and explained in a way that was easy to understand. The best part was that I found money that I didn’t know I had! I would definitely recommend Profile to anyone who needs pension advice or to find a lost pension.</p>
